# Third-party notices

What the Go builds (GoLearn extension and setup page, GoPractice, the controlled reader prototype) contain from
others, with the licence each requires us to state. The full inventory and the open legal questions are in
`docs/ecosystem/audit/RIGHTS-AND-ATTRIBUTION.md`. This file is a notice, not a legal opinion.

## Data

  Licence: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
  Contributors: the Wiktionary contributors (https://en.wiktionary.org). Processing: kaikki.org (Tatu Ylonen, "Wiktextract").
  Source: https://kaikki.org/dictionary/Albanian/kaikki.org-dictionary-Albanian.jsonl.gz (the address recorded in the
  dictionary's manifest). The file actually used is the kaikki "+tables" variant, `kaikki.org-dictionary-Albanian+tables.jsonl`
  (128,809 lines); its exact download address is not recorded.
  Edition: `kaikki-sq@2026-09-28`. The file's last-modified date is 2026-09-28, it was retrieved on 2026-10-01 and the
  shards were built on 2026-10-01 (SHA-256 of the file: `f63836cd29026f1c070c0702d926dc31e3427abb289e3fd9048ca382acf7c014`).
  The Wiktionary revision the extract was taken from is not recorded.
  Changes: the shards are an adaptation of the kaikki file. It was reformatted into per-prefix JSON files, each entry keeps
  at most six glosses (spelling-variant senses are left out), entries that repeat are merged, and example sentences are not
  shipped (only a count of them). The shards are offered under the same
  licence, CC BY-SA 4.0.

## Code bundled into the applications

- **ts-fsrs** 5.4.2 — MIT License, Copyright (c) Open Spaced Repetition (https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/ts-fsrs).
  Bundled in GoPractice (the GoReview scheduler).
- **epub.js** 0.3.93 — BSD 2-Clause License, Copyright (c) FuturePress (https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js).
  Used by the controlled reader prototype only (not in the extension or GoPractice builds).

Build tooling (Vite, esbuild, TypeScript, Vitest, jsdom and their dependencies) is not distributed in the builds.

## Typefaces

- **EB Garamond** (Latin subset, regular, italic and semibold) — SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.
  Copyright 2017 The EB Garamond Project Authors (https://github.com/octaviopardo/EBGaramond12).
  Licence text: `EB-Garamond-OFL.txt` (shipped beside this file in every build, and in `fonts/`); also at https://scripts.sil.org/OFL.
  Source: the `@fontsource/eb-garamond` distribution of the Google Fonts release (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/EB+Garamond).
  Files: `eb-garamond-latin-400.woff2`, `eb-garamond-latin-400-italic.woff2`, `eb-garamond-latin-600.woff2`
  (kept in `packages/shared-fonts/`; copied into the builds as `fonts/` beside the stylesheet: `assets/fonts/` in the GoPractice and hosted
  setup builds, `app/fonts/` in the extension). Used unmodified, as web fonts, for GoPractice, the GoLearn setup page and the action popup;
  the lookup card names it first in its serif stack but cannot load it. The fonts are not sold by themselves.

## Audio

- No third-party audio is shipped. The German demonstration clip referenced by GoListen's registry
  (Wikimedia Commons `De-Guten_Tag.oga`, public-domain dedication by the uploader) is a test fixture in the
  repository and is not copied into any build.

## Our own material

The Albanian word list, word-form rules, phrase list, construction rules, tutorial, writing prompts and validation
sentences are owner-authored and machine-drafted (not reviewed by a native speaker) and are labelled so in the
product.
